Electric Vehicle Data Analysis | Tableau Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data using Tableau, focusing on vehicle growth trends, electric range, manufacturer dominance, geographic distribution, and CAFV eligibility. The dashboard is designed to provide clear, interactive, and actionable insights into the evolving EV landscape.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the growth of electric vehicles over the years

Compare BEV vs PHEV adoption

Identify top manufacturers and popular EV models

Analyze state-wise EV distribution

Understand CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility
